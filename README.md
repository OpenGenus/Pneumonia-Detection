# Pneumonia-Detection

We are trying to make a model for inhancing the health system for detection many thoracic diseases.
this for educational purposes.
### To run the code be sure that you have the following :
1. Python 3.9.16 
2. tensorflow 2.11.0
3. keras 2.11.0
### commands to run the code:
python main_model.py --> For creating a model that is ready to train on your dataset to detect Pneumonia

python 14_disease_model.py --> For creating a model that is ready to train on your dataset to detect 14 different thoracic diseases which are
Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Edema, Effusion, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Hernia, Infiltration, Mass, Nodule, Pleural Thickening, Pneumonia, and Pneumothorax.
